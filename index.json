Resistance change in oxide-based synapses is caused by the motion of oxygen vacancies. HfOx-based synapses typically demonstrate an abrupt nonlinear resistance change under positive bias application (set), limiting their viability as analog memory. In this work, a thin barrier layer of AlOx or SiOx is added to the bottom electrode/oxide interface to slow the migration of oxygen vacancies. Electrical results show that the resistance change in HfOx/SiOx devices is more controlled than the HfOx devices during the set. While the on/off ratio for the HfOx/SiOx devices is still large (∼10), it is shown to be smaller than that of HfOx/AlOx and HfOx devices. Finite element modeling suggests that the slower oxygen vacancy migration in HfOx/SiOx devices during reset results in a narrower rupture region in the conductive filament. The narrower rupture region causes a lower high resistance state and, thus, a smaller on/off ratio for the HfOx/SiOx devices. Overall, the results show that slowing the motion of oxygen vacancies in the barrier layer devices improves the resistance change during the set but lowers the on/off ratio.","tags":[],"title":"Trade-off between Gradual Set and On/Off Ratio in HfOx-Based Analog Memory with a Thin SiOx Barrier Layer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1683590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683590400,"objectID":"9961218fcedaa69ca60d639768b6c448","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/post/ibm/","publishdate":"2023-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ibm/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"05/20/2023 - I am starting an internship at IBM TJ Watson Research Center.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Matthew P West","Georges Pavlidis","Robert H Montgomery","Fabia Farlin Athena","Muhammad S Jamil","Andrea Centrone","Samuel Graham","Eric M Vogel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682899200,"objectID":"e0ba275943d89f03b844b2d8efb53989","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/jap_mat/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jap_mat/","section":"publication","summary":"As the demand for computing applications capable of processing large datasets increases, there is a growing need for new in-memory computing technologies. Oxide-based resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices are promising candidates for such applications because of their industry readiness, endurance, and switching ratio. These analog devices, however, suffer from poor linearity and asymmetry in their analog resistance change. Various reports have found that the temperature in RRAM devices increases locally by more than 1000 K during operation. Therefore, temperature control is of paramount importance for controlling their resistance. In this study, scanning thermal microscopy is used to map the temperature of Au/Ti/HfOx/Au devices at a steady power state and to measure temperature dynamics of the top electrode above the filament location during both resistive switching loops and voltage pulsing. These measurements are used to verify the thermal parameters of a multiphysics finite elements model. The model is then used to understand the impact of thermal conductivities and boundary conductances of constituent materials on resistance change during the first reset pulse in RRAM devices. It is found that the resistance change can be reduced significantly when the temperature in the titanium capping layer is reduced. We find that the greatest temperature reduction and, therefore, the lowest resistance change in the device are afforded by capping layers with increased thermal conductivities. This work links thermal properties to the resistance change in RRAM devices, providing critical insights into engineering devices with improved switching dynamics.","tags":[],"title":"Thermal environment impact on HfOx RRAM operation: A nanoscale thermometry and modeling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1681689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681689600,"objectID":"ef6cabf4fb82ba37554187ad9297548d","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/post/colonel-oscar/","publishdate":"2023-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/colonel-oscar/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"04/17/2023 - I have received the Colonel Oscar P.

Also, with the known electrical response of a memristor, one can confirm its usefulness in non-volatile memory and/or in artificial neural networks. Although bi- or multi-layered oxides have been reported to improve the switching performance, compared to the single oxide layer, the detailed explanation about why the switching can easily be improved for some oxides combinations is still missing. Herein, we fabricated two types of bi-layered heterostructure devices, quasi-HfOx/AlOy and AlOy/HfOx sandwiched between Au electrodes, and their electrical responses are investigated. For a deeper understanding of the switching mechanism, the performance of a HfOx only device is also considered, which serves as a control device. The role of bi-layered heterostructures is investigated using both the experimental and simulated results. Our results suggest that synergistic switching performance can be achieved with a proper combination of these materials and/or devices. These results open the avenue for designing more efficient double- or multi-layers memristor devices for an analog response.","tags":[],"title":"Asymmetric Resistive Switching of Bilayer HfO x/AlO y and AlO y/HfO x Memristors: The Oxide Layer Characteristics and Performance Optimization for Digital Set and Analog Reset Switching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew P West","Fabia Farlin Athena","Eric M Vogel","Samuel Graham"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675209600,"objectID":"aa23dcb1e7c11ae604ef141ea8bae4c6","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/apl/","publishdate":"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/apl/","section":"publication","summary":"Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices have been widely studied for neuromorphic, in-memory computing. One of the most studied RRAM structures consists of a titanium capping layer and a HfOx adaptive oxide. Although these devices show promise in improving neuromorphic circuits, high variability, non-linearity, and asymmetric resistance changes limit their usefulness. Many studies have improved linearity by changing materials in or around the device, the circuitry, or the analog bias conditions. However, the impact of prior biasing conditions on the observed analog resistance change is not well understood. Experimental results in this study demonstrate that prior higher reset voltages used after forming cause a greater resistance change during subsequent identical analog pulsing. A multiphysics finite element model suggests that this greater analog resistance change is due to a higher concentration of oxygen ions stored in the titanium capping layer with increasing magnitude of the reset voltage. This work suggests that local ion concentration variations in the titanium capping layer of just tens of atoms cause significant resistance variation during analog operation.","tags":[],"title":"Bias history impacts the analog resistance change of HfOx-based neuromorphic synapses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

To extrapolate these insights towards larger DNN training workloads in simulations, we establish an analog switching test sequence and extract key device statistics from 6T1R ReRAM arrays (up to 2k devices) built on a 14nm CMOS baseline. With this, we find that for larger DNN workloads, device and algorithm co-optimization shows dramatic improvements in comparison to standard SGD and baseline ReRAM.

In this work, the impact of measurement conditions (pulse amplitude and pulse width) and titanium dopants on the analog resistance change of atomic layer deposited hafnium oxide memristor synapses are studied. A lower pulse amplitude improves the linearity of resistance change as a function of the number of pulses but results in a smaller memory window. The addition of titanium dopants does not substantively change the analog resistance modulation of hafnium oxide. Density functional theory calculations show that titanium strongly impacts oxygen ion motion in the HfxTiyOz matrix but does not impact significantly in the HfTi metallic filament. This study demonstrates that the analog characteristic of HfxTiyOz artificial synapses is largely independent of the titanium doped bulk oxide since the resistance change is primarily controlled by the HfTi metallic conducting filament.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of titanium doping and pulsing conditions on the analog temporal response of hafnium oxide based memristor synapses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabia Farlin Athena","Matthew P West","Jinho Hah","Riley Hanus","Samuel Graham","Eric M Vogel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646092800,"objectID":"5635ec029557e49b8a9fd0614cdbd455","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/rsc/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rsc/","section":"publication","summary":"HfOx-Based resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices are being widely considered as both non-volatile memories for digital computation and synaptic memory for neuromorphic computing applications.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns demonstrated that Mn substitution in BHFO led to a structural transition from rhombohedral (R3c) to orthorhombic (Pn21a) phase. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) showed that Mn doping decreased particle size and consequently higher percentages of Mn resulted agglomeration of particles severely. In this case particle sizes reduced from 60 nm to 30 nm. For Mn doping up to 5% in BHFO nanoparticles, the saturation magnetization (Ms) was enhanced, implying suppression of space modulated spin structure by structural transition. However, for a further increase of doping up to 15%, the Ms was started to decrease again. UV–Visible absorption spectra revealed that Mn substitution in BHFO led to strong reduction of band gap energy significantly. Band gap decreased from 2.9 to 2.38 eV on Mn doping, which allows the absorption of light extended to visible range.","tags":[],"title":"Size Dependent Magnetic and Optical Properties of Mn Doped Bi0. 9Ho0. 1FeO3 Nanoparticles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tilottoma Saha","Fabia Farlin Athena","MA Matin","Ahmed Sharif"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"608a6684446584b17671c64dc9f69112","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/ug_2/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ug_2/","section":"publication","summary":"To improve the vacancy related defects associated with pure BiFeO3 (BFO) different Ba-Mn co-doped samples (Bi1-xBaxFeyMnyO3; x = 0.1; y = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) were prepared from sol-gel method.

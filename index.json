Resistance change in oxide-based synapses is caused by the motion of oxygen vacancies. HfOx-based synapses typically demonstrate an abrupt nonlinear resistance change under positive bias application (set), limiting their viability as analog memory. In this work, a thin barrier layer of AlOx or SiOx is added to the bottom electrode/oxide interface to slow the migration of oxygen vacancies. Electrical results show that the resistance change in HfOx/SiOx devices is more controlled than the HfOx devices during the set. While the on/off ratio for the HfOx/SiOx devices is still large (∼10), it is shown to be smaller than that of HfOx/AlOx and HfOx devices. Finite element modeling suggests that the slower oxygen vacancy migration in HfOx/SiOx devices during reset results in a narrower rupture region in the conductive filament. The narrower rupture region causes a lower high resistance state and, thus, a smaller on/off ratio for the HfOx/SiOx devices. Overall, the results show that slowing the motion of oxygen vacancies in the barrier layer devices improves the resistance change during the set but lowers the on/off ratio.","tags":[],"title":"Trade-off between Gradual Set and On/Off Ratio in HfOx-Based Analog Memory with a Thin SiOx Barrier Layer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1683590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683590400,"objectID":"9961218fcedaa69ca60d639768b6c448","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/post/ibm/","publishdate":"2023-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ibm/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"05/20/2023 - I am starting an internship at IBM TJ Watson Research Center.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Matthew P West","Georges Pavlidis","Robert H Montgomery","Fabia Farlin Athena","Muhammad S Jamil","Andrea Centrone","Samuel Graham","Eric M Vogel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682899200,"objectID":"e0ba275943d89f03b844b2d8efb53989","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/jap_mat/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jap_mat/","section":"publication","summary":"As the demand for computing applications capable of processing large datasets increases, there is a growing need for new in-memory computing technologies. Oxide-based resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices are promising candidates for such applications because of their industry readiness, endurance, and switching ratio. These analog devices, however, suffer from poor linearity and asymmetry in their analog resistance change. Various reports have found that the temperature in RRAM devices increases locally by more than 1000 K during operation. Therefore, temperature control is of paramount importance for controlling their resistance. In this study, scanning thermal microscopy is used to map the temperature of Au/Ti/HfOx/Au devices at a steady power state and to measure temperature dynamics of the top electrode above the filament location during both resistive switching loops and voltage pulsing. These measurements are used to verify the thermal parameters of a multiphysics finite elements model. The model is then used to understand the impact of thermal conductivities and boundary conductances of constituent materials on resistance change during the first reset pulse in RRAM devices. It is found that the resistance change can be reduced significantly when the temperature in the titanium capping layer is reduced. We find that the greatest temperature reduction and, therefore, the lowest resistance change in the device are afforded by capping layers with increased thermal conductivities. This work links thermal properties to the resistance change in RRAM devices, providing critical insights into engineering devices with improved switching dynamics.","tags":[],"title":"Thermal environment impact on HfOx RRAM operation: A nanoscale thermometry and modeling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681257600,"objectID":"79392c96c030a18e00d07817773c68a8","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/post/stanford_talk1/","publishdate":"2023-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/stanford_talk1/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"04/12/2023 - I gave a talk at Stanford University.","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1681689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681689600,"objectID":"ef6cabf4fb82ba37554187ad9297548d","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/post/colonel-oscar/","publishdate":"2023-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/colonel-oscar/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"04/17/2023 - I have received the Colonel Oscar P.

Also, with the known electrical response of a memristor, one can confirm its usefulness in non-volatile memory and/or in artificial neural networks. Although bi- or multi-layered oxides have been reported to improve the switching performance, compared to the single oxide layer, the detailed explanation about why the switching can easily be improved for some oxides combinations is still missing. Herein, we fabricated two types of bi-layered heterostructure devices, quasi-HfOx/AlOy and AlOy/HfOx sandwiched between Au electrodes, and their electrical responses are investigated. For a deeper understanding of the switching mechanism, the performance of a HfOx only device is also considered, which serves as a control device. The role of bi-layered heterostructures is investigated using both the experimental and simulated results. Our results suggest that synergistic switching performance can be achieved with a proper combination of these materials and/or devices. These results open the avenue for designing more efficient double- or multi-layers memristor devices for an analog response.","tags":[],"title":"Asymmetric Resistive Switching of Bilayer HfO x/AlO y and AlO y/HfO x Memristors: The Oxide Layer Characteristics and Performance Optimization for Digital Set and Analog Reset Switching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew P West","Fabia Farlin Athena","Eric M Vogel","Samuel Graham"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1675209600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675209600,"objectID":"aa23dcb1e7c11ae604ef141ea8bae4c6","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/apl/","publishdate":"2023-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/apl/","section":"publication","summary":"Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices have been widely studied for neuromorphic, in-memory computing. One of the most studied RRAM structures consists of a titanium capping layer and a HfOx adaptive oxide. Although these devices show promise in improving neuromorphic circuits, high variability, non-linearity, and asymmetric resistance changes limit their usefulness. Many studies have improved linearity by changing materials in or around the device, the circuitry, or the analog bias conditions. However, the impact of prior biasing conditions on the observed analog resistance change is not well understood. Experimental results in this study demonstrate that prior higher reset voltages used after forming cause a greater resistance change during subsequent identical analog pulsing. A multiphysics finite element model suggests that this greater analog resistance change is due to a higher concentration of oxygen ions stored in the titanium capping layer with increasing magnitude of the reset voltage. This work suggests that local ion concentration variations in the titanium capping layer of just tens of atoms cause significant resistance variation during analog operation.","tags":[],"title":"Bias history impacts the analog resistance change of HfOx-based neuromorphic synapses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

In this study, we investigated the effect of oxygen ion concentration at the HfOx/Ti interface on the behavior of HfOx-based filamentary memristors. Devices with higher oxygen ion concentrations at the HfOx surface were fabricated by treating with oxygen plasma at various times on the as grown ~ 5 nm HfOx active layer via atomic layer deposition. Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and depth profile analyses verify the excess oxygen ion presence at the HfOx surface, and the formation of a thin TiOx layer between the HfOx and Ti layers, resulting in a HfOx/TiOx/Ti interface structure.

In this work, the impact of measurement conditions (pulse amplitude and pulse width) and titanium dopants on the analog resistance change of atomic layer deposited hafnium oxide memristor synapses are studied. A lower pulse amplitude improves the linearity of resistance change as a function of the number of pulses but results in a smaller memory window. The addition of titanium dopants does not substantively change the analog resistance modulation of hafnium oxide. Density functional theory calculations show that titanium strongly impacts oxygen ion motion in the HfxTiyOz matrix but does not impact significantly in the HfTi metallic filament. This study demonstrates that the analog characteristic of HfxTiyOz artificial synapses is largely independent of the titanium doped bulk oxide since the resistance change is primarily controlled by the HfTi metallic conducting filament.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of titanium doping and pulsing conditions on the analog temporal response of hafnium oxide based memristor synapses","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1652187600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652187600,"objectID":"0110892f1c3184d3c22fc5f22d86a2dc","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/talk/mrs-spring-2022-controlling-the-oxygen-ion-motion-using-a-diffusion-barrier-layer-in-hfox-based-analog-memory/","publishdate":"2022-05-10T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mrs-spring-2022-controlling-the-oxygen-ion-motion-using-a-diffusion-barrier-layer-in-hfox-based-analog-memory/","section":"event","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"MRS Spring 2022 - Controlling the Oxygen Ion Motion Using a Diffusion Barrier Layer in HfOx-Based Analog Memory","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"(i) Investigation into the dynamics of Ti/HfOx synapses via modeling - I developed a compact model based on Trap-Assisted Tunneling and Ohmic transport principles to understand the working principle of adaptive oxide memristors.

This model also enabled simulations of analog pulse impacts on rupture thickness and extraction of barrier-height parameters at the oxide/electrode interface.2 We observed barrier height impacts the current responses.

The model replicated experimental analog resistance change and temperature-driven current-voltage relationships up to ~200°C. This model also enabled simulations of analog pulse impacts on rupture thickness and extraction of barrier-height parameters at the oxide/electrode interface.2 We observed barrier height impacts the current responses. Consequently, it is anticipated that the active layer dopant will affect the barrier height, and thereby, the resistance change. (ii) **Exploration of the impact of active layer dopant** - I explored the impact of titanium dopant on the Atomic Layer Deposited HfOx active layer by varying Hf to Ti ratios. This exploration unveiled that increased titanium doping leads to higher vacancy concentration, signified by a decrease in bonded oxygen.

The variation of Mn doping in Bi0.9Ho0.1FeO3(BHFO)on the properties such as morphological, structural, magnetic, and optical have been investigated in this study. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns demonstrated that Mn substitution in BHFO led to a structural transition from rhombohedral (R3c) to orthorhombic (Pn21a) phase. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) showed that Mn doping decreased particle size and consequently higher percentages of Mn resulted agglomeration of particles severely. In this case particle sizes reduced from 60 nm to 30 nm. For Mn doping up to 5% in BHFO nanoparticles, the saturation magnetization (Ms) was enhanced, implying suppression of space modulated spin structure by structural transition. However, for a further increase of doping up to 15%, the Ms was started to decrease again. UV–Visible absorption spectra revealed that Mn substitution in BHFO led to strong reduction of band gap energy significantly. Band gap decreased from 2.9 to 2.38 eV on Mn doping, which allows the absorption of light extended to visible range.","tags":[],"title":"Size Dependent Magnetic and Optical Properties of Mn Doped Bi0. 9Ho0. 1FeO3 Nanoparticles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tilottoma Saha","Fabia Farlin Athena","MA Matin","Ahmed Sharif"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"608a6684446584b17671c64dc9f69112","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/ug_2/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ug_2/","section":"publication","summary":"To improve the vacancy related defects associated with pure BiFeO3 (BFO) different Ba-Mn co-doped samples (Bi1-xBaxFeyMnyO3; x = 0.1; y = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) were prepared from sol-gel method. The influence of co-doping on structural, magnetic and optical properties of BiFeO3 has been studied in different experimental conditions. Particle size and magnetic properties were measured from SEM and VSM analysis respectively. Again band gap was calculated from UV analysis. The co-doped samples showed reduced particles size as well as better surface morphology. M-H loops suggest that the presence of Mn2+ increased ferromagnetic quantity at some levels. Still room temperature occurrence of ferromagnetism obtained from M-H loops of all samples showed weak ferromagnetic behaviour. In addition the incorporation of Ba2+ at Bi3+ site and Mn2+ at Fe3+ site decreased the band gap which was evidenced by increased optical property.","tags":[],"title":"Theoretical and Experimental Evidence of Modified Structure, Magnetism and Optical Properties in Ba and Mn Co-Substituted BiFeO3","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"6c8a545b9bdd8a56c5291bd2505343de","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/project/perf/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/perf/","section":"project","summary":"(i) **Addition of barrier layer in HfOx devices** - Oxygen ion dynamics influence resistance changes. Integrating a SiOx (\u003c 1 nm) barrier layer near the reset anode interface can control this, leading to gradual resistance changes during positive analog pulses. While the HfOx/SiOx devices outperform standard ones, there's a trade-off between linearity and switching window because of a small oxide formation in the filament. The barrier layer devices, despite better linearity, have high reset current densities, necessitating further low-power synapse investigation. (ii) **Off-current reduction using ultrathin multilayered low thermally conductive materials** - I posited that electrodes with low thermal conductivity could localize heat in the filament, thereby enlarging the rupture oxide area and decreasing current density. While most such materials are unsuitable as electrodes, the MAX phase uniquely combines low thermal conductivity with high electrical conductivity. Because of ultrathin multi layered structure MAX phase can confine heat and can act as a better oxygen reservoir for memristor. I fabricated memristors with MAX phase electrodes , verifying the fabrication via methods such as Raman Spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, in-situ XRD. These devices displayed ultra-low reset current density, high on-off ratio, and superior endurance, emphasizing the promise of MAX phase materials in energy-efficient, high-density memory systems.","tags":["ReRAM","layered material","comsol","simulation"],"title":"Improving the Performance of Adaptive Oxide Memristors","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1272326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1272326400,"objectID":"82dd92892e9fb71685397e7fa1be5e53","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/project/dl/","publishdate":"2010-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dl/","section":"project","summary":"(i) **Recovery of Deep Learning Performance of a degraded array** - In my quest to examine the practical applications of adaptive oxide-based memristors in deep learning, I collaborated with IBM T.

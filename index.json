To extrapolate these insights towards larger DNN training workloads in simulations, we establish an analog switching test sequence and extract key device statistics from 6T1R ReRAM arrays (up to 2k devices) built on a 14nm CMOS baseline. With this, we find that for larger DNN workloads, device and algorithm co-optimization shows dramatic improvements in comparison to standard SGD and baseline ReRAM. The gap to the reference floating-point accuracy across various tested DNNs indicates that further material and algorithmic optimizations are still needed. This work shows a pathway for scalable in-memory deep learning training using ReRAM crossbar arrays.","tags":[],"title":"Deep learning acceleration in 14nm CMOS compatible ReRAM array: device, material and algorithm co-optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinho Hah","Matthew P West","Fabia Farlin Athena","Riley Hanus","Eric M Vogel","Samuel Graham"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652832000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652832000,"objectID":"5ac5f1363b2b1bfdeb8842bcbbfa2a6e","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/jinho/","publishdate":"2022-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jinho/","section":"publication","summary":"Moving toward the future computing and non-volatile memory, memristors have gained wide attention for their in-memory computing and neuromorphic computing applications. The resistive switching dynamics in oxide-based memristors rely critically on oxygen ions and their recombination with oxygen vacancies to partially rupture and form the conductive filament (CF) for modulating the device between the low resistance state and high resistance state. In this study, we investigated the effect of oxygen ion concentration at the HfOx/Ti interface on the behavior of HfOx-based filamentary memristors. Devices with higher oxygen ion concentrations at the HfOx surface were fabricated by treating with oxygen plasma at various times on the as grown ~ 5 nm HfOx active layer via atomic layer deposition. Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and depth profile analyses verify the excess oxygen ion presence at the HfOx surface, and the formation of a thin TiOx layer between the HfOx and Ti layers, resulting in a HfOx/TiOx/Ti interface structure. This work demonstrates the importance of interface chemistry at the HfOx/Ti interface region and its oxygen ion motion for controlled growth of the CF during memristor set operation, which is favorable for analog logic computation.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of oxygen concentration at the HfOx/Ti interface on the behavior of HfOx filamentary memristors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabia Farlin Athena","Matthew P West","Pradip Basnet","Jinho Hah","Qi Jiang","Wei-Cheng Lee","Eric M Vogel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"815a491bb03b35bbfa09786aab49802f","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/jap/","publishdate":"2022-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jap/","section":"publication","summary":"Hafnium oxide non-volatile memories have shown promise as an artificial synapse in neuromorphic computing architectures. However, there is still a need to fundamentally understand how to reliably control the analog resistance change induced by oxygen ions that partially rupture or re-form the conductive filament. In this work, the impact of measurement conditions (pulse amplitude and pulse width) and titanium dopants on the analog resistance change of atomic layer deposited hafnium oxide memristor synapses are studied. A lower pulse amplitude improves the linearity of resistance change as a function of the number of pulses but results in a smaller memory window. The addition of titanium dopants does not substantively change the analog resistance modulation of hafnium oxide. Density functional theory calculations show that titanium strongly impacts oxygen ion motion in the HfxTiyOz matrix but does not impact significantly in the HfTi metallic filament. This study demonstrates that the analog characteristic of HfxTiyOz artificial synapses is largely independent of the titanium doped bulk oxide since the resistance change is primarily controlled by the HfTi metallic conducting filament.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of titanium doping and pulsing conditions on the analog temporal response of hafnium oxide based memristor synapses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabia Farlin Athena","Matthew P West","Jinho Hah","Riley Hanus","Samuel Graham","Eric M Vogel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646092800,"objectID":"5635ec029557e49b8a9fd0614cdbd455","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/rsc/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rsc/","section":"publication","summary":"HfOx-Based resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices are being widely considered as both non-volatile memories for digital computation and synaptic memory for neuromorphic computing applications.

Also, with the known electrical response of a memristor, one can confirm its usefulness in non-volatile memory and/or in artificial neural networks. Although bi- or multi-layered oxides have been reported to improve the switching performance, compared to the single oxide layer, the detailed explanation about why the switching can easily be improved for some oxides combinations is still missing. Herein, we fabricated two types of bi-layered heterostructure devices, quasi-HfOx/AlOy and AlOy/HfOx sandwiched between Au electrodes, and their electrical responses are investigated. For a deeper understanding of the switching mechanism, the performance of a HfOx only device is also considered, which serves as a control device. The role of bi-layered heterostructures is investigated using both the experimental and simulated results. Our results suggest that synergistic switching performance can be achieved with a proper combination of these materials and/or devices. These results open the avenue for designing more efficient double- or multi-layers memristor devices for an analog response.","tags":[],"title":"Quasi-HfOx/ AlOy and AlOy/ HfOx Based Memristor Devices: Role of Bi-layered Oxides in Digital Set and Analog Reset Switching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabia Farlin Athena","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The variation of Mn doping in Bi0.9Ho0.1FeO3(BHFO)on the properties such as morphological, structural, magnetic, and optical have been investigated in this study. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns demonstrated that Mn substitution in BHFO led to a structural transition from rhombohedral (R3c) to orthorhombic (Pn21a) phase. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) showed that Mn doping decreased particle size and consequently higher percentages of Mn resulted agglomeration of particles severely. In this case particle sizes reduced from 60 nm to 30 nm. For Mn doping up to 5% in BHFO nanoparticles, the saturation magnetization (Ms) was enhanced, implying suppression of space modulated spin structure by structural transition. However, for a further increase of doping up to 15%, the Ms was started to decrease again. UV–Visible absorption spectra revealed that Mn substitution in BHFO led to strong reduction of band gap energy significantly. Band gap decreased from 2.9 to 2.38 eV on Mn doping, which allows the absorption of light extended to visible range.","tags":[],"title":"Size Dependent Magnetic and Optical Properties of Mn Doped Bi0. 9Ho0. 1FeO3 Nanoparticles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tilottoma Saha","Fabia Farlin Athena","MA Matin","Ahmed Sharif"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"608a6684446584b17671c64dc9f69112","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/ug_2/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ug_2/","section":"publication","summary":"To improve the vacancy related defects associated with pure BiFeO3 (BFO) different Ba-Mn co-doped samples (Bi1-xBaxFeyMnyO3; x = 0.1; y = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) were prepared from sol-gel method. The influence of co-doping on structural, magnetic and optical properties of BiFeO3 has been studied in different experimental conditions. Particle size and magnetic properties were measured from SEM and VSM analysis respectively. Again band gap was calculated from UV analysis. The co-doped samples showed reduced particles size as well as better surface morphology. M-H loops suggest that the presence of Mn2+ increased ferromagnetic quantity at some levels. Still room temperature occurrence of ferromagnetism obtained from M-H loops of all samples showed weak ferromagnetic behaviour. In addition the incorporation of Ba2+ at Bi3+ site and Mn2+ at Fe3+ site decreased the band gap which was evidenced by increased optical property.","tags":[],"title":"Size Dependent Magnetic and Optical Properties of Mn Doped Bi0. 9Ho0. 1FeO3 Nanoparticles","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

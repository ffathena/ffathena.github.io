SiL positively shifts the threshold voltage (VT) of AOS transistors, providing at least four distinct VT levels with a maximum increase of 500 mV. It achieves stable VT control without significantly degrading critical device parameters such as mobility and on-state current, all while keeping the process temperature below 225 °C and requiring no additional heat treatment to activate the dipole. Positive-bias temperature instability tests at 85 °C indicate a significant reduction in negative VT shifts for SiL-integrated devices, highlighting enhanced reliability. Incorporating this SiL gate stack into two-transistor gain-cell (GC) memory maintains a more stable storage node voltage (VSN)—reducing VSN drop by 67%—by limiting unwanted charge losses. SiL-engineered GCs also reach retention times up to 10,000 s at room temperature and reduce standby leakage current by three orders of magnitude relative to the baseline device, substantially lowering refresh energy consumption.","tags":[],"title":"Gate Dielectric Engineering with an Ultrathin Silicon-oxide Interfacial Dipole Layer for Low-Leakage Oxide-Semiconductor Memories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabia Farlin Athena","Xiangjin Wu","Nathaniel S.

In advanced transistor architectures, such as gate-all-around nanosheets, the conventional channel-first process involves depositing dielectrics directly onto the channel. Atomic layer deposition of gate dielectrics on back-end-of-line compatible channel materials, such as amorphous oxide semiconductors, can induce defects or cause structural modifications that degrade electrical performance. While post-deposition annealing can partially repair this damage, it often degrades other device metrics. We report a novel channel-last concept that prevents such damage. Channel-last gate-all-around self-aligned transistors with amorphous oxide-semiconductor channels exhibit high on-state current (\u003e 1 mA/μm) and low subthreshold swing (minimum of 63 mV/dec) without the need for post-deposition processing. This approach offers a general, scalable pathway for transistors with atomic layer deposited channel materials, enabling the future of low-power three-dimensional electronics.","tags":[],"title":"Channel-last gate-all-around nanosheet oxide semiconductor transistors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabia Farlin Athena","Cooper A.

However, high contact resistances plague the performance of 2D-based devices. Thus, non-destructive doping strategies are needed in order to overcome this challenge for complementary (n-type and p-type) 2D logic. Here, we present the use of functional polymers to non-destructively introduce charge transfer n-type and p-type doping in 2D materials. First, we utilize a multitask graph neural network (GNN), trained on density functional theory–calculated properties, to predict properties like ionization energy and electron affinity of candidate polymers. These predictions are then used to select polymers capable of doping n-type and p-type monolayer MoS2 and WSe2 based on band-level alignment criteria. We validate our screening strategy with Raman spectroscopy, confirming successful p-type doping of WSe2 with PEDOT:PSS and Nafion, and n-type doping of MoS2 with PEI and WSe2 with p(gPyDPP-MeOT2). The results demonstrate a practical model-to-lab pipeline that effectively narrows the search space for polymer dopants, bridging high-throughput computational materials screening with experimental validation.","tags":[],"title":"Graph Neural Network Guided Selection of Functional Polymers for Charge Transfer Doping of 2D Materials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabia Farlin Athena","J.

However, repeated read/write operations and standby state cause prolonged bias stress and device self-heating, resulting in progressive negative threshold voltage shifts (ΔVT).

We define a “critical temperature” (Tcrit )- the point at which hydrogen release mechanism overtake deep-electron trapping and show that Dopt  with Tcrit  near 85∘C exhibits significantly lower ΔVT at 85∘C compared to Dstd.  Further analysis reveals that very high Tcrit values (e.g., 125∘C) increase temperature sensitivity highlighting the importance of designing OSFETs around an optimal Tcrit for reliable, high throughput data buffering.","tags":[],"title":"Optimization is Key to High-Temperature Reliability in Oxide-Semiconductor FETs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1743984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1743984000,"objectID":"e7465e09f7219ae2195ee8528d8af595","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/post/sigma-xi/","publishdate":"2025-04-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/sigma-xi/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"04/07/2025 - I received the Sigma Xi Best Ph.D. Thesis Award at Georgia Tech.","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1735689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1735689600,"objectID":"aca99073955ee2f8fb00a2b540ffb531","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/post/forbes/","publishdate":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/forbes/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"01/01/2025 - I was selected in Forbes 30 under 30 North America 2025.","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1733922000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1733922000,"objectID":"6cbed21304598cc765c6dbb41b9ac3bc","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/talk/iedm-first-demonstration-of-an-n-p-oxide-semiconductor-complementary-gain-cell-memory/","publishdate":"2024-12-11T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/iedm-first-demonstration-of-an-n-p-oxide-semiconductor-complementary-gain-cell-memory/","section":"event","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"IEDM - First Demonstration of an N-P Oxide Semiconductor Complementary Gain Cell Memory","type":"event"},{"authors":["Fabia Farlin Athena","Takashi Ando","Paul Michael Solomon","Nanbo Gong","Guy M.

A simulation based on statistical 14 nm CMOS ReRAM array data provides insights into the performance of transfer learning on larger network workloads, exhibiting notable improvement over conventional training with random initialization. This study shows that analog DNN transfer learning using an optimized ReRAM array can achieve faster convergence with a smaller dataset compared to training from scratch, thus augmenting AI capability at the edge.","tags":[],"title":"Demonstration of Transfer Learning Using 14 nm Technology Analog ReRAM Array","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701388800,"objectID":"15bd097e3bddd17c28b22cfbf5f0d76c","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/post/mrs_award/","publishdate":"2023-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mrs_award/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"12/01/2023 -

Resistance change in oxide-based synapses is caused by the motion of oxygen vacancies. HfOx-based synapses typically demonstrate an abrupt nonlinear resistance change under positive bias application (set), limiting their viability as analog memory. In this work, a thin barrier layer of AlOx or SiOx is added to the bottom electrode/oxide interface to slow the migration of oxygen vacancies. Electrical results show that the resistance change in HfOx/SiOx devices is more controlled than the HfOx devices during the set. While the on/off ratio for the HfOx/SiOx devices is still large (∼10), it is shown to be smaller than that of HfOx/AlOx and HfOx devices. Finite element modeling suggests that the slower oxygen vacancy migration in HfOx/SiOx devices during reset results in a narrower rupture region in the conductive filament. The narrower rupture region causes a lower high resistance state and, thus, a smaller on/off ratio for the HfOx/SiOx devices. Overall, the results show that slowing the motion of oxygen vacancies in the barrier layer devices improves the resistance change during the set but lowers the on/off ratio.","tags":[],"title":"Trade-off between Gradual Set and On/Off Ratio in HfOx-Based Analog Memory with a Thin SiOx Barrier Layer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1683590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683590400,"objectID":"9961218fcedaa69ca60d639768b6c448","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/post/ibm/","publishdate":"2023-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ibm/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"05/20/2023 - I am starting an internship at IBM TJ Watson Research Center.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Matthew P West","Georges Pavlidis","Robert H Montgomery","Fabia Farlin Athena","Muhammad S Jamil","Andrea Centrone","Samuel Graham","Eric M Vogel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1682899200,"objectID":"e0ba275943d89f03b844b2d8efb53989","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/jap_mat/","publishdate":"2023-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jap_mat/","section":"publication","summary":"As the demand for computing applications capable of processing large datasets increases, there is a growing need for new in-memory computing technologies. Oxide-based resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices are promising candidates for such applications because of their industry readiness, endurance, and switching ratio. These analog devices, however, suffer from poor linearity and asymmetry in their analog resistance change. Various reports have found that the temperature in RRAM devices increases locally by more than 1000 K during operation. Therefore, temperature control is of paramount importance for controlling their resistance. In this study, scanning thermal microscopy is used to map the temperature of Au/Ti/HfOx/Au devices at a steady power state and to measure temperature dynamics of the top electrode above the filament location during both resistive switching loops and voltage pulsing. These measurements are used to verify the thermal parameters of a multiphysics finite elements model. The model is then used to understand the impact of thermal conductivities and boundary conductances of constituent materials on resistance change during the first reset pulse in RRAM devices. It is found that the resistance change can be reduced significantly when the temperature in the titanium capping layer is reduced. We find that the greatest temperature reduction and, therefore, the lowest resistance change in the device are afforded by capping layers with increased thermal conductivities. This work links thermal properties to the resistance change in RRAM devices, providing critical insights into engineering devices with improved switching dynamics.","tags":[],"title":"Thermal environment impact on HfOx RRAM operation: A nanoscale thermometry and modeling study","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1682208000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681257600,"objectID":"79392c96c030a18e00d07817773c68a8","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/post/stanford_talk1/","publishdate":"2023-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/stanford_talk1/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"04/12/2023 - I gave a talk at Stanford University.","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1681689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1681689600,"objectID":"ef6cabf4fb82ba37554187ad9297548d","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/post/colonel-oscar/","publishdate":"2023-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/colonel-oscar/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"04/17/2023 - I have received the Colonel Oscar P.

Also, with the known electrical response of a memristor, one can confirm its usefulness in non-volatile memory and/or in artificial neural networks. Although bi- or multi-layered oxides have been reported to improve the switching performance, compared to the single oxide layer, the detailed explanation about why the switching can easily be improved for some oxides combinations is still missing. Herein, we fabricated two types of bi-layered heterostructure devices, quasi-HfOx/AlOy and AlOy/HfOx sandwiched between Au electrodes, and their electrical responses are investigated. For a deeper understanding of the switching mechanism, the performance of a HfOx only device is also considered, which serves as a control device. The role of bi-layered heterostructures is investigated using both the experimental and simulated results. Our results suggest that synergistic switching performance can be achieved with a proper combination of these materials and/or devices.

One of the most studied RRAM structures consists of a titanium capping layer and a HfOx adaptive oxide. Although these devices show promise in improving neuromorphic circuits, high variability, non-linearity, and asymmetric resistance changes limit their usefulness. Many studies have improved linearity by changing materials in or around the device, the circuitry, or the analog bias conditions. However, the impact of prior biasing conditions on the observed analog resistance change is not well understood. Experimental results in this study demonstrate that prior higher reset voltages used after forming cause a greater resistance change during subsequent identical analog pulsing. A multiphysics finite element model suggests that this greater analog resistance change is due to a higher concentration of oxygen ions stored in the titanium capping layer with increasing magnitude of the reset voltage. This work suggests that local ion concentration variations in the titanium capping layer of just tens of atoms cause significant resistance variation during analog operation.","tags":[],"title":"Bias history impacts the analog resistance change of HfOx-based neuromorphic synapses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

The resistive switching dynamics in oxide-based memristors rely critically on oxygen ions and their recombination with oxygen vacancies to partially rupture and form the conductive filament (CF) for modulating the device between the low resistance state and high resistance state. In this study, we investigated the effect of oxygen ion concentration at the HfOx/Ti interface on the behavior of HfOx-based filamentary memristors. Devices with higher oxygen ion concentrations at the HfOx surface were fabricated by treating with oxygen plasma at various times on the as grown ~ 5 nm HfOx active layer via atomic layer deposition. Detailed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and depth profile analyses verify the excess oxygen ion presence at the HfOx surface, and the formation of a thin TiOx layer between the HfOx and Ti layers, resulting in a HfOx/TiOx/Ti interface structure. This work demonstrates the importance of interface chemistry at the HfOx/Ti interface region and its oxygen ion motion for controlled growth of the CF during memristor set operation, which is favorable for analog logic computation.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of oxygen concentration at the HfOx/Ti interface on the behavior of HfOx filamentary memristors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabia Farlin Athena","Matthew P West","Pradip Basnet","Jinho Hah","Qi Jiang","Wei-Cheng Lee","Eric M Vogel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652486400,"objectID":"815a491bb03b35bbfa09786aab49802f","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/jap/","publishdate":"2022-05-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jap/","section":"publication","summary":"Hafnium oxide non-volatile memories have shown promise as an artificial synapse in neuromorphic computing architectures. However, there is still a need to fundamentally understand how to reliably control the analog resistance change induced by oxygen ions that partially rupture or re-form the conductive filament. In this work, the impact of measurement conditions (pulse amplitude and pulse width) and titanium dopants on the analog resistance change of atomic layer deposited hafnium oxide memristor synapses are studied. A lower pulse amplitude improves the linearity of resistance change as a function of the number of pulses but results in a smaller memory window. The addition of titanium dopants does not substantively change the analog resistance modulation of hafnium oxide. Density functional theory calculations show that titanium strongly impacts oxygen ion motion in the HfxTiyOz matrix but does not impact significantly in the HfTi metallic filament. This study demonstrates that the analog characteristic of HfxTiyOz artificial synapses is largely independent of the titanium doped bulk oxide since the resistance change is primarily controlled by the HfTi metallic conducting filament.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of titanium doping and pulsing conditions on the analog temporal response of hafnium oxide based memristor synapses","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1652187600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652187600,"objectID":"0110892f1c3184d3c22fc5f22d86a2dc","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/talk/mrs-spring-2022-controlling-the-oxygen-ion-motion-using-a-diffusion-barrier-layer-in-hfox-based-analog-memory/","publishdate":"2022-05-10T13:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/mrs-spring-2022-controlling-the-oxygen-ion-motion-using-a-diffusion-barrier-layer-in-hfox-based-analog-memory/","section":"event","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"MRS Spring 2022 - Controlling the Oxygen Ion Motion Using a Diffusion Barrier Layer in HfOx-Based Analog Memory","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"(i) Investigation into the dynamics of Ti/HfOx synapses via modeling - I developed a compact model based on Trap-Assisted Tunneling and Ohmic transport principles to understand the working principle of adaptive oxide memristors.

The variation of Mn doping in Bi0.9Ho0.1FeO3(BHFO)on the properties such as morphological, structural, magnetic, and optical have been investigated in this study. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns demonstrated that Mn substitution in BHFO led to a structural transition from rhombohedral (R3c) to orthorhombic (Pn21a) phase. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) showed that Mn doping decreased particle size and consequently higher percentages of Mn resulted agglomeration of particles severely. In this case particle sizes reduced from 60 nm to 30 nm. For Mn doping up to 5% in BHFO nanoparticles, the saturation magnetization (Ms) was enhanced, implying suppression of space modulated spin structure by structural transition. However, for a further increase of doping up to 15%, the Ms was started to decrease again. UV–Visible absorption spectra revealed that Mn substitution in BHFO led to strong reduction of band gap energy significantly. Band gap decreased from 2.9 to 2.38 eV on Mn doping, which allows the absorption of light extended to visible range.","tags":[],"title":"Size Dependent Magnetic and Optical Properties of Mn Doped Bi0. 9Ho0. 1FeO3 Nanoparticles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tilottoma Saha","Fabia Farlin Athena","MA Matin","Ahmed Sharif"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"608a6684446584b17671c64dc9f69112","permalink":"https://ffathena.github.io/publication/ug_2/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ug_2/","section":"publication","summary":"To improve the vacancy related defects associated with pure BiFeO3 (BFO) different Ba-Mn co-doped samples (Bi1-xBaxFeyMnyO3; x = 0.1; y = 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) were prepared from sol-gel method.

The co-doped samples showed reduced particles size as well as better surface morphology. M-H loops suggest that the presence of Mn2+ increased ferromagnetic quantity at some levels. Still room temperature occurrence of ferromagnetism obtained from M-H loops of all samples showed weak ferromagnetic behaviour.

Integrating a SiOx (\u003c 1 nm) barrier layer near the reset anode interface can control this, leading to gradual resistance changes during positive analog pulses. While the HfOx/SiOx devices outperform standard ones, there's a trade-off between linearity and switching window because of a small oxide formation in the filament. The barrier layer devices, despite better linearity, have high reset current densities, necessitating further low-power synapse investigation.

While most such materials are unsuitable as electrodes, the MAX phase uniquely combines low thermal conductivity with high electrical conductivity. Because of the ultrathin multi-layered structure, the MAX phase can confine heat and act as a better oxygen reservoir for the memristor. I fabricated memristors with MAX phase electrodes, verifying the fabrication via methods such as Raman Spectroscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, and in-situ XRD. These devices displayed ultra-low reset current density, high on-off ratio, and superior endurance, emphasizing the promise of MAX phase materials in energy-efficient, high-density memory systems.
